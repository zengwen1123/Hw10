## Summary

2 players can make mark like circle and cross to represent their team, and if they have 3 same mark in a row or hypotenuse, the team wins.


## Component Parts

Describe the components, or pieces, that make up your project.

Include what types of inputs/outputs/data it will use. You can also upload an image with a diagram showing how all those pieces are connected.

I will use mouse x to draw lines, a grid that they cannot touch, and a system that can recognize them winning.

## When your project is completed, you will then add the following sections:
